    question:
      "Explain how a binary search tree (BST) maintains sorted order during insertions and deletions.",
    answer:
      "A BST keeps all left descendants less than the node and all right descendants greater than the node.",

    answer:
      "A singly linked list allows traversal in one direction, while a doubly linked list allows traversal in both directions.",

    question:
      "Describe the process and purpose of the 'heapify' operation in a binary heap data structure?",
    answer:
      "Heapify ensures that a binary heap maintains its heap property after inserting or deleting a node.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is the purpose of the 'lazy propagation' technique in segment trees and how does it work?",
    answer:
      "Lazy propagation in segment trees delays updates to avoid unnecessary operations, improving efficiency.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "How does the quicksort algorithm achieve its average-case time complexity of O(n log n)?",
    answer:
      "Quicksort partitions the array and recursively sorts the subarrays, achieving O(n log n) on average.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is a priority queue and how is it commonly implemented using a binary heap?",
    answer:
      "A priority queue allows elements to be processed based on priority, often implemented using a binary heap for efficiency.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Explain the concept of dynamic programming and how it optimizes recursive algorithms.",
    answer:
      "Dynamic programming stores the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations, optimizing recursive algorithms.",

  {
    question:
      "What is the significance of the 'big-O' notation in analyzing algorithm performance?",

  {
    question:
      "How does a depth-first search (DFS) differ from a breadth-first search (BFS) in graph traversal?",
    answer:
      "DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, while BFS explores all neighbors level by level.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Describe how the merge sort algorithm works and its time complexity in the best, worst, and average cases.",
    answer:
      "Merge sort divides the array into halves, recursively sorts them, and merges, achieving O(n log n) in all cases.",
